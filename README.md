# LED_CHASER_CIRCUIT_DESIGN_TINKERCAD

This simple LED Chaser Circuit can be designed using 555 Timer IC and CD4017 Decade Counter IC. The LED CHASER CIRCUIT aims in providing the serial switching of LED's in a continuous manner. In a short duration of time, they are being switched and results in the formation of chasing pattern.

HARDWARE COMPONENTS: 555 Timer IC, Johnson Decade Counter IC (CD4017), Resistors, Capacitors, LED's, Breadboard small, 9V Battery, Connecting wires (Jumper wires).
